## Reporting a Vulnerability
 
 Reporting vulnerabilities is quick and easy via the `Issues` 
 section on GitHub. The vulnerability will usually be fixed 
 between 4hrs - 3 days. When reporting vulnerabilities please 
 refer to the `file`, `section` and `line` in which it is located.
 Please don't report vulnerabilities via the `Discussions` section.
 All issues are seen so if you think we're taking too long, this 
 is probably because of:                                  
 • You haven't signified the location of the problem's `file`, 
   `section` or `line`        or                   
 • It's a major issue which requires a full release.
